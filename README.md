Spice-up is a modern and intuitive desktop presentation app based upon [SpiceOfDesign's presentation concept](http://spiceofdesign.deviantart.com/art/New-Presentation-Concept-401767854). Built from the ground up for elementary OS, it gives you everything you need to create simple and beautiful presentations.
