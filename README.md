### Create Simple and Beautiful presentations


Spice-up is a modern and intuitive desktop presentation app based upon [SpiceOfDesign's presentation concept](http://spiceofdesign.deviantart.com/art/New-Presentation-Concept-401767854). Built from the ground up for elementary OS, it gives you everything you need to create simple and beautiful presentations.

### Spice Presentations Look Amazing!
Images, shapes, Text, as well as beautiful background patterns and easy to make custom gradients!


### Coming Soon
- Animations and transitions
- Pre-defined layouts and themes
- And much more!
